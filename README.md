tweeted to give impression that comments on Mann ki Baat was turned off due to fear of students.

Fact is.. Comments of all videos on PMO Youtube is off from years.

Same Mann Ki Baat was available on NaMO and BJP channel, comments was allowed.

during Sri Lanka suicide bombings defended Terrorists and instead attacked Indian Journalists calling the letter shared by them as Fake

The letter was Correct

Why was a Fact Checker so worried about defending Islamic Terrorists?
